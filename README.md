# Retell

`Retell` is an app to get you famous quotes from famous people around the world. This app is created to demonstrate the integration of `SuperTokens` Authentication with `Nextjs`. 

In this branch we have implemented the following features:
- Create an API to fetch the famous quotes.
- Create a `Nextjs` app to display the quotes.
