# Retell

`Retell` is an app to get you famous quotes from famous people around the world. This app is created to demonstrate the integration of `SuperTokens` Authentication with `Nextjs`. 

We use the `Passwordless` recipe of SuperTokens to fetch quotes in a guarded way and show them in a `Nextjs` component.
